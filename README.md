# GarrysMod-Code
Various and miscellaneous code for Garry's Mod.

Some incomplete, some tests, some random snippets/ideas.

Folders are structured like addons, but not necessarily addons themselves.


### Contents:
./quicktool is an addon by `!cake` that is in the process of being changed and improved.
I have express permission to edit and upload these changes within this repository.

./Puggle's Various Scripts is a really old directory that contains many old files I worked on or made.
Some date back to 2010-11 and haven't been touched since.
Some files are duplicated/older versions of files in other root folders in this repository.
